2. Props are immutable 
A component should manage its own state, but it should not manage its own props. 
props is essentially "state that is managed by the component owner." That's why props are immutable. React docs also recommends to treat state as if it's immutable. 
That is because by manipulating this.
so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props
